# Intelligent_Battleship ðŸ¤–
Project exam for "Introduzione all'intelligenza Artificiale" at Unisveristy of studies of Perugia

Within this project i created an intelligent battleship player which is able to read the grid from the camera, create the battlefield and attack on the coordinates with the highest probability to have a portion of a ship.

If you wanna try and see how it works just run the code and press "space" to shot. ðŸš€

Enjoy!
